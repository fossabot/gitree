# gitree

A CLI tool that recursively scans directories for Git repositories and displays them in a tree structure with inline status information.

## About

This project serves as an exploration of [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), a specification-driven development framework. All design artifacts,
implementation plans, and project governance are maintained in the `.specify/` directory.

## Features

- **Tree visualization**: Displays Git repositories in an ASCII tree structure (similar to the `tree` command)
- **Inline Git status**: Shows branch name, ahead/behind counts, stashes, and uncommitted changes
- **Concurrent scanning**: Asynchronously extracts Git status for multiple repositories in parallel
- **Bare repository support**: Detects and displays both regular and bare repositories
- **Graceful error handling**: Continues operation when encountering inaccessible repositories

Example output:

```text
.
├── project-a [[ main | ↑2 ↓1 $ * ]]
├── project-b [[ develop | ○ ]]
└── libs
    ├── lib-core [[ main ]]
    └── lib-utils [[ DETACHED | * ]]
```

**Status symbols**:

- Branch name or `DETACHED` for detached HEAD
- `↑N` - commits ahead of remote
- `↓N` - commits behind remote
- `○` - no remote configured
- `$` - has stashes
- `*` - has uncommitted changes
- `bare` - bare repository

## Build

```bash
make build              # Build binary to bin/gitree
```

## Usage

Run from any directory to scan for Git repositories:

```bash
./bin/gitree
```

The tool will recursively scan the current directory and display all Git repositories in a tree format with their status.

## Development

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for build commands, architecture details, and development conventions.

### Testing

```bash
make test               # Run all tests
make lint               # Format code and run linters
```

### Project Governance

This project follows a constitution-driven development approach. See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for core principles including:

- **Library-First**: Features start as standalone libraries
- **CLI Interface**: Text in/out protocol with JSON and human-readable formats
- **Test-First**: Mandatory TDD with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Observability**: Structured logging and debuggability
- **Simplicity**: YAGNI principles with complexity tracking
